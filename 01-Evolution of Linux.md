# Introduction to Linux
- Linux is a powerful, **open-source operating system** that serves as the backbone of countless technologies that we use everyday.
- It was created by **Linus Torvalds in 1991** and is based on **Unix** operating system.
- At its core, **Linux is a Kernel** - a fundamental part of OS that is responsible for managing hardware and system resources.
- It comes with both GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface).
- Examples: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, etc.

## Why study Linux?
- Over 96% of web servers are currently running on Linux
- Low cost
- Open Source
- Ease of scalablity

# Open Source Philosophy
- Open Source is a concept of making source code available for public use or modification from its original design.
- Examples: Apache Server, Wordpress, Terraform, etc.
- The source code is released by the software or programs original designers under the terms of a software license agreement. The software license defines what users can modify in the orignal package distribution and how they can redistribute those modifications to the general public.
- Open Source community includes various types of software licenses:
    - GNU General Public License
    - Apache License
    - MIT License
    - Unlicense

# Linux Distributions
- Linux is packaged into something known as distribution (distros).
- Each distro consists of:
    - Linux Kernel
    - Supporting software and libraries
    - Configuration files
- Different distributions have different scripts and utilities to launch programs.

## Linux Kernel
- Linux Kernel is a core part of Linux Operating System and it acts as a bridge between software applications and computer hardware.
- It is reponsible for managing system's resources, such as CPU, memory, processes, and i/o devices.
- The Linux kernel is monolithic, this means that the kernel carries out CPU scheduling, memory management and several operations by itself.
- The Linux Kernel is also modular, which means it can extends its capabilities through the use of dynamically loaded kernel modules.

## Linux Distributions Installation
- Can download directly from their developers websites (**Image file on a CD**). 
- Can use a small program to install that to a **USB flash drive** and use that as a installation media.
- Virtual server or cloud service.

# Distribution Life Cycle
## Release Schedule
- It's a Distribution Lifecycle that specifies when are new version released and makes available to general public.

## Pre-Release Versions
- This are recommended to use only for testing and debugging
- Types:
    - Alpha: very new and contains a lot of bugs
    - Beta: where most tesing is done

## Support Versions
- STS (Short Term Support)
- LTS (Long Term Support)

## Rolling release sucedules
- For some distros, version upgrades can involve downloading an entirely new image of the new version, and installing it as if it was a brand new operating system (time consuming).
- While some distros offer rolling release schedules, which means that upgrading occurs in an ongoing manner (removes the need to install it as a brand new OS).

## Examples
- Disco Dingo (19.04), Cosmic Cuttlefish (18.10)

# Embedded Systems 
- Embedded system is a controller with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

## Example Applications
- Industrial automation
- Navigation equipment
- Medical devices
- Wearable technology
- Home appliances

### Examples
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- Android
    - Highly-scalable
    - User-friendly
    - Open source
    - Free to use

# Hardware Requirements
## System Requirements
- These are the pre-requisites that are often used as a guide and not an absolute rule.

## Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)
- Lists tested, compatible, and sometimes incompatible hardware devices for a particular distribution.

## Minimum Requirements
- The lowest possible hardware specification that your computer should have to boot successfully and use with basic functionality.

## Recommended Requirements
- Hardware that one should have in order to fully maximize a system's potential.

# Operating System Differences
## Windows
- 90% of home users
- Widely-available and widely-supported
- Most prone to malware
- Requires a license
- GUI-based

## Mac OS
- 7% of home users
- Free but only works on Apple systems
- GUI-based

## Linux
- Less than 2% of home users
- More than 75% of enterprise server environments
- Known as the OS for computer experts and hackers
- Source code is available for modification
- Open source
- Can run from the command line only
